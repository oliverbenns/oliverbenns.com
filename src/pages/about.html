	One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.

<p>
	One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
	<em>transformed</em> in his bed into a horrible
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin" title="Wikipedia Vermin"
		>vermin</a
	>. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he
	could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
	sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it
	and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
	compared with the size of the rest of him, link waved abouthelplessly as he
	looked. <cite>“What&#39;s happened to me?”</cite> he thought. It wasn&#39;t
	a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay
	peacefully between its four familiar walls.

	It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
	raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
	viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm disappeared..

	First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, above all
	have breakfast, and only then consider further action, for (he noticed this
	clearly) by thinking things over in bed he would not reach a reasonable
	conclusion. He remembered that he had already often felt a light pain or
	other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward lying position, which later
	turned out to be purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was eager to see
	how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate. That the change in his
	voice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an occupational
	illness of commercial travelers, of that he had not the slightest doubt.

	It was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed only to push himself
	up a little, and it fell by itself. But to continue was difficult,
	particularly because he was so unusually wide. He needed arms and hands to
	push himself upright. Instead of these, however, he had only many small
	limbs which were incessantly moving with very different motions and which,
	in addition, he was unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them,
	then it was the first to extend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing
	with this limb what he wanted, in the meantime all the others, as if left
	free, moved around in an excessively painful agitation. &quot;But I must not
	stay in bed uselessly,&quot; said Gregor to himself.

		At first he wanted to get off the bed with the lower part of his body,
		but this lower part (which he incidentally had not yet looked at and
		which he also couldn&#39;t picture clearly) proved itself too difficult
		to move. The attempt went so slowly. When, having become almost frantic,
		he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without
		thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower
		bedpost hard. The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower
		part of his body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.

	Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and turned his
	head carefully toward the edge of the bed. He managed to do this easily, and
	in spite of its width and weight his body mass at last slowly followed the
	turning of his head. But as he finally raised his head outside the bed in
	the open air, he became anxious about moving forward any further in this
	manner, for if he allowed himself eventually to fall by this process, it
	would take a miracle to prevent his head from getting injured. And at all
	costs he must not lose consciousness right now. He preferred to remain in
	bed.
